Classes in this folder are stripped down copies from TiledPluginCore.
They are included so WfcMap can reference LayeredTileMap.
They are used like an interface during development to expose the required members.
These copies are not included in the game project.
The TiledPlugin will include it's own copiesin teh game project, in the same namespace, which contain the actual functionality.
